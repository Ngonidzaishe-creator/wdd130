    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Ngonidzaishe Chareka</strong> and I am from Zimbabwe. I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho studying Web and Computer Programming. I enjoy learning how to build websites, solving technical challenges, and improving my coding skills. Outside of schoolwork, I enjoy traveling, exploring nature, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
    
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new ideas, traveling to new places, and connecting with people from different cultures. I also have a strong interest in design and how websites can improve communication and make information easier to access. One of my goals is to become a skilled front-end developer and eventually expand into full-stack development.</p>
    
    <p>This course, <em>WDD 130</em>, is an exciting step for me because it allows me to strengthen my foundation in HTML, CSS, and the basics of creating user-friendly websites. I am looking forward to building projects that reflect both my personality and my growing skills as a developer.</p>
