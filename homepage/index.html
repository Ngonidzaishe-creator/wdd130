      <p>Hello! My name is Ngonidzaishe Chareka and I am from Zimbabwe. I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho studying Web and Computer Programming. 
        I enjoy learning how to build websites, solving technical challenges, and improving my coding skills. Outside of schoolwork, I enjoy traveling, exploring nature, and spending time with family and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy exploring new ideas, traveling to new places, and connecting with people from 
        different cultures. I also have a strong interest in design and how websites can improve communication 
        and make information easier to access. One of my goals is to become a skilled front-end developer and 
        eventually expand into full-stack development.
          </p>
          <p>
        This course, WDD 130, is an exciting step for me because it allows me to strengthen my foundation in 
        HTML, CSS, and the basics of creating user-friendly websites. I am looking forward to building projects 
        that reflect both my personality and my growing skills as a developer.
